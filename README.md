# "City Builder"
Done as a project for Programming Theory Mission in Learn.Unity
By making this project I killed two birds with one stone,
beside using OOP concepts I have also reached out to Learning Action Plan tutorial from one of previous stepps in this Pathway.

Bear in mind that using the OOP concepts is very purpose of this Learn.Unity misson so if you feel like some OOP principle is forced in a code its because it is.
